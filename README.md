# SVM-Classification-for-Heart-Disease-Prediction-
In this repository we will see what is this heart disease (binary classification data) prediction problem parameters/variable values and try to fit this values in a Support Vector Machine.

To run the code follow the below steps:

1.Install python(3.6+) and need packages.
```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip instll pandas
```
```
pip install matplotlib
```
```
pip install -U scikit-learn
```


2.Clone this repository .
```
https://github.com/karthikeyanthanigai/SVM-Classification-for-Heart-Disease-Prediction-.git
```
3.Open command line and set the directory to the cloned repository.
```
cd SVM-Classification-for-Heart-Disease-Prediction-
```
4.Enter the command.
```
python svm.py
```

if you got any error in install the packages then refer [Stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com).
